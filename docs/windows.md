# How to create or change a keyboard layout?
On the Windows operating system, use
[Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).

If you've never worked with it before, it's highly recommended to read its
documentation (`Help > Contents...`). It explains everything that you may need
to know.

If you want to contribute your layout or changes to an existing one, make sure
that you follow the [rules](rules.md).
