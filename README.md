# About
This repository is a collection of keyboard layouts that allow you to write
in Esperanto in a compatible with your first language way, and without
installing additional software.

The layouts can be found in a `README.md` file of each layout.

The layouts can be installed using installers published in the `Releases`
section.

# Why?
Although there is already plenty of Esperanto keyboard layouts and software
that allows writing in Esperanto, non of them provides a good user experience.

As a user:
- I don't want to install additional software (installing a layout is okay).
- I want Esperanto to be an extension of the layout for my first language
  (I don't want switching between layouts). If it's not possible,
  I want to write in Esperanto the same way as I write in my first language,
  as much as it's possible.
- I want the Esperanto layout to be as logical as possible, so that I don't need
  to learn it before being able to use it.

# Why multiple layouts instead of a single one?
Physical keyboards are labeled using a language of a country they were inteded
for. It's easier for users of such layouts to continue using the same layout
for Esperanto as well. Depending on languages, it also allows writing multiple
languages at the same time, without switching between different layouts.

# Contributions
There is a lot of languages, keyboard layouts, and operating systems in our
world. If you know a language, or use an operating system, for which there is
no Esperanto layout in this repository yet, your help is welcome.

Another option is to improve existing layouts by making them more convenient
for writing in the first language and Esperanto. Quite a lot of keys are not
assigned yet, so it's a chance to come up with something useful.

You can find more information about how to work with keyboard layouts
in the project Wiki.
